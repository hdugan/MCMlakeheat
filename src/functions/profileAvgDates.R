# Selection of Representative Fall Profile Dates
#
# To compare lake profiles across years, we selected a single representative
# fall date for each lake that was most consistently sampled over time. Profiles
# were commonly collected on different dates each year, so to maximize
# interannual comparability, we identified the day of year (DOY) that minimized
# the total difference between actual sampling dates and a standardized
# reference date.
#
# For each lake, we iteratively tested all DOYs between 300 and 365 (late
# October to December 31). For each candidate DOY, we calculated the absolute
# difference in days between this reference date and the actual sampling dates
# for each year. When multiple profiles were collected in a single year, we used
# the earlier date, the later date, or their averageâ€”whichever was closest to
# the reference DOY. We summed these minimum distances across all years, and
# selected the DOY that minimized this total distance as the representative
# sampling date for that lake. This approach allowed us to identify a
# lake-specific fall date that was most consistently sampled across years,
# reducing variability due to shifting sampling schedules.
#
# Once the optimal DOY was determined, we extracted the corresponding closest
# actual profile (or average of two) for each year to create a consistent annual
# time series of fall conditions.
